NandGame Answers
Last updated September 16, 2025

This repository contains detailed solutions for NandGame, a browser-based educational game that teaches the fundamentals of computer architecture starting entirely from NAND gates. The project is designed to serve as a learning resource for anyone interested in how digital logic, circuits, and CPUs are built up step by step.

The answers are written and organized in a way that makes it easier to follow the logical progression of the game. Beginning with the construction of the most basic logic gates, the solutions gradually move toward increasingly complex systems such as adders, multiplexers, memory units, and eventually a functioning CPU. Each solution demonstrates not only how to complete a level but also why each design choice works.

Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to provide a clear path for students, hobbyists, and enthusiasts who want to deepen their understanding of digital logic and computer design. By working through the solutions, learners can see how complex computational systems are not built all at once, but instead are carefully layered from the ground up, starting with the simplest universal gate.

This repository is not only a collection of answers but also a guide to understanding the thought process behind each step. Whether you are studying computer engineering, computer science, or simply exploring how computers work at their core, these solutions can serve as a valuable companion.
